# Haptick - a 6DOF force sensitive input device

This design is a work in progress and is currently in the proof-of-concept prototyping phase. Progress is being documented via a series of [blog posts](https://blog.ioces.com/matt).

Ultimately the goal is to produce an open source alternative to the various [Spacemice](http://spacemice.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) on the market.
